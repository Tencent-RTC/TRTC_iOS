 * Module:   GenerateTestUserSig
 *
 * Function: Used to generate UserSig for testing. UserSig is a security protection signature designed by Tencent Cloud for its cloud services.
 * The calculation method is to encrypt SDKAppID, UserID and EXPIRETIME, and the encryption algorithm is HMAC-SHA256.
 *
 * Attention: Please do not publish the following code into your online official version of the App for the following reasons:
 *
 *            Although the code in this file can correctly calculate UserSig, it is only suitable for quickly adjusting the basic functions of the SDK and is not suitable for online products.
 *            This is because the SDKSECRETKEY in the client code is easily decompiled and reverse-engineered, especially the web-side code, which is almost zero difficulty in cracking.
 *            Once your key is compromised, an attacker can calculate the correct UserSig to steal your Tencent Cloud traffic.
 *
 *            The correct approach is to put the UserSig calculation code and encryption key on your business server, and then have the App obtain the real-time calculated UserSig from your server on demand.
 *            Since it's more expensive to hack a server than a client app, a server-computed approach better protects your encryption keys.

/*
 * Module:   GenerateTestUserSig
 *
 * Description: generates UserSig for testing. UserSig is a security signature designed by Tencent Cloud for its cloud services.
 *           It is calculated based on `SDKAppID`, `UserID`, and `EXPIRETIME` using the HMAC-SHA256 encryption algorithm.
 *
 * Attention: do not use the code below in your commercial app. This is because:
 *
 *            The code may be able to calculate UserSig correctly, but it is only for quick testing of the SDK’s basic features, not for commercial apps.
 *            `SDKSECRETKEY` in client code can be easily decompiled and reversed, especially on web.
 *             Once your key is disclosed, attackers will be able to steal your Tencent Cloud traffic.
 *
 *            The correct method is to deploy the `UserSig` calculation code and encryption key on your project server so that your app can request from your server a `UserSig` that is calculated whenever one is needed.
 *           Given that it is more difficult to hack a server than a client app, server-end calculation can better protect your key.
