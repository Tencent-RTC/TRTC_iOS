/*
 * Module: GenerateTestUserSig
 *
 * Function: used to generate UserSig for testing. UserSig is a security protection signature designed by Tencent Cloud for its cloud services.
 * The calculation method is to encrypt SDKAppID, UserID and EXPIRETIME, and the encryption algorithm is HMAC-SHA256.
 *
 * Attention: Please do not publish the following code into your online official version of the App for the following reasons:
 *
 * Although the code in this file can correctly calculate UserSig,
 * it is only suitable for quickly adjusting the basic functions of the SDK and is not suitable for online products.
 * This is because the SDKSECRETKEY in the client code is easily decompiled and reverse-engineered, especially the web-side code,
 * which is almost zero difficulty in cracking.
 * Once your key is leaked, an attacker can calculate the correct UserSig to steal your Tencent Cloud traffic.
 *
 * The correct approach is to put the UserSig calculation code and encryption key on your business server,
 * and then have the App obtain the real-time calculated UserSig from your server on demand.
 * Since it is more expensive to crack a server than a client app, a server-computed approach better protects your encryption keys.
